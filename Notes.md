No binary executables, libraries or object files should go in a git repository. 
Any files that is produced by a compilation process is not stores in the repo.

A good code is composed by several translation units and the one cointaining the main files contains onle that and maybe a few helper functions.

For the rest programming is not bad. Comments in the code.
